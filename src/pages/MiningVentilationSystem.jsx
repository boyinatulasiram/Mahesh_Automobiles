       "Mining ventilation is defined as a combined system of shafting, ducting, and a well-designed combination of fans. Mine ventilation is a basic need for Mining industries.

Mining ventilation fans are used to supply adequate oxygen for the workforce and dilute and exhaust dangerous gasses in the underground mine.",

Our Serpent Ventilation System has been tried and tested in hundreds of underground installations. The system is composed of highly efficient, low-noise fans and durable PVC-coated ventilation ducting. Our experts can help you design and install low-cost ventilation to reduce your energy consumption by up to 15-20% and to help reduce carbon dioxide. And with our Serpent Automatic, which adjusts the fan speed, you will have an automatic ventilation control.`,
